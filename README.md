# GoPlayGround
Welcome to me teaching myself Golang. 

# General notes while learning
variables work similarly to Kotlin 
:= is short hand for declare and init variables
slices are similar to lists 
Golang uses pointers and structs! 

Package names are very import to have correct. If you have a main function you need to have the package be main
otherwise the package name needs to match the folder you are working in.

# Testing
by convention test files need to be name_test.go and in the same folder as what you are testing.
